<h1 style="font-family:Candara;">The Endangerment of Rainforests<br>In this Generation.</h1><br>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
There are various reasons why Rainforests are endangered in the world today and here are some of the <b>main causes,</b><br>
the <b>effects and dangers,</b><br>
and <b>why we should stop:</b><br>

<ul>
<h2 style="background-color:#f2e387;"<b>Deforestation</b></h2>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<b>What is Deforestation?</b><br>
Deforestation is when humans <b>remove</b> or thin forests for lumber or to use the land where the trees stood.<br>
<b>The main Causes of Deforestation</b><br>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-Industrial Agriculture</b><br></li>
	<li><b>Farming</b></li>
Agriculture is the <b>second main</b> cause of forest conversion in the Amazon.<br>
In addition to deforestation, agricultural practices tend to cause significant <b>soil erosion</b> and <abbr title="Water pollution caused by particulate terrestrial clastic material, with a particle size dominated by silt or clay.">river siltation</abbr>,<br>
as well as aquatic contamination with agrochemicals.<br>
</ul>



<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-Timber Logging</b><br></li>
 	<li><b>Felling Trees</b></li>
The falling of a single large tree can bring down dozens of surrounding trees which are linked to the target tree by vines.<br>

It can <b>damage habitat,</b> <b>diminish levels of biodiversity and food sources,</b><br>
<b>degrade the soil, pollute rivers and lands,</b> and cause areas to dry out affecting the overall productivity for the peoples and animals that live there.
</ul>


<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-Illegal Mining</b><br></li>
	<li><b>Digging</b></li>
Mining is a significant driver of deforestation. Not only do mines clear native forests for mineral extraction,<br>
they also often establish new infrastructure, which indirectly facilitates new access to land and further clearing.
</ul><br>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<b>The Effects and Dangers of Deforestation</b><br>
It affects the water cycle, <b>destroys</b> the flora and fauna,leads to an <b>increase</b> in carbon dioxide.
Forest loss and damage is the cause of around <b>10%</b>of global warming.<br>
There's simply no way we can fight the climate crisis if we don't <b>stop deforestation.</b><br><br>
<b>Why we should stop</b><br>
It helps protect the <b>millions</b> of plant and animal speciesâ€”many of which are <b>indigenous</b> to tropical forests and in danger of <b>extinction.</b><br>
If the current rate of deforestation continues, the world's rain forests will vanish <b>within 100 years,</b><br>
causing unknown effects on global climate and <b>eliminating</b> the majority of plant and animal species on the planet.

<h2 style="background-color:#f0df77;"<b>Over-Exploitation</b></h2>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<b>What is Over-Exploitation?</b><br>
Over-Exploitation occurs when harvesting exceeds reproduction of wild plant and animal species.<br>
<b>The main Causes of Over-Exploitation</b><br>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-Humans Killing a species for valuebles</b><br></li>
	<li><b>Poaching</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
People that kill and displace animals in rainforests at mass are a <b>big contribution</b> to why certain species are going <b>extinct.</b> <br>
The same problem with various <b>plants, soils and habitats.</b> Some animals that get <b>poached</b> in the rainforest are elepahnts, tigers, <br>
Monkeys, Pangolans etc.

</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-Increasing Population</b><br></li>
	<li><b>More People = More Reasources Needed</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Our popualtion is growing by the second and more peope need <b>more reasources</b> in order to make our way of living easier. <br>
Companies dont realise that more they <b>harvest</b> and take from the Earth, the worse it becomes for them and the <br>
rest of the world. Our increasing population needs better <b>eco-friendly</b> solutions to their problems.
</ul>
<ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><b>-No Eco-Friendly Options</b><br></li>
	<li><b>A sad future</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
Over-Exploiting is already an issue but if we start becoming dependant on those goods then we need to come up with <b>Eco-Friendly</b> options.<br>
Eco-Friendly optiions could be something like <b>planting a tree</b> after cutting down another and then not cut down trees in <br>
<b>that area again</b><br><br>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<b>The Effects and Dangers of Over-Exploitation</b><br>
When trees are over exploited conditions change very quickly, the <b>soil dries</b> up and causes erosion.<br>
<b>Poaching and hunting</b> are a major issue in the tropical rainforest, exotic creatures are being over<br>
hunted causing their populations to go into the <b>danger zones</b> and on the verge of extinction.<br><br>
<b>Why we should stop</b><br>
Overexploitation means <b>harvesting</b> species from the wild at rates faster than natural populations can recover.<br>
Overfishing and <b>overhunting</b> are both types of overexploitation. Currently, about <b>a third</b> of the world's endangered vertebrates are <b>threatened</b>
 by overexploitation.
