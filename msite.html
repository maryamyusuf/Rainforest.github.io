<i>Think that there is still a lot of Rainforests left?</i><br>
Here are some <b>commonly heard names</b> of the Rainforests that are suffering:<br>
<b>26%</b>of the Amazon Rainforest has been deforested. Australia's tropical Rianforest tree's have been dying at double the previous rate since the 1980's because global heating.<br>
These are some <b>hotspot locations</b> that just barely have any habitat left:<br>
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li><i>The Mountains of Southwest China</i> have about <b>8%</b> remaining Habitat.</li>
	<li><i>The Phillaphines</i> have <b>7%</b> remaining habitat.
	<li><i>Sundaland</i> which is in <i>Indonesia/Malaysia</i> have <b>7%</b> left.</li>
	<li><i>New Zealand</i> has <b>only</b> <i><b>5%</b></i> of its Rainforests remaining.</li>
</ul><br>

<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
<i><b>Yes they do.</b></i><br>
Rainforests play an extremely huge role in our environment even if we dont realise it. Rainforest's keep our planet <b>healthy.</b> Human's are dependant on oxygen to survive and Rainforests help with that. <br>
By absorbing the extra <abbr title="Carbon Dioxide">COâ‚‚</abbr> which helps <b>stabalize</b> the Earth's climate and releasing huge amounts of oxygen for us to breath and <b>survive.</b><br>
Humans are the ones who need the Rainforests more than <b>anyone!</b><br>
 We use the materials like various types of <b>wood</b> and <b>exotic plants</b> to make houses and decorations.<br>
We also see that Rainforest as something <b>beautiful and amazing</b> but are the ones that are ruining it.<br>
People use it to test their <b>survival skills</b> in the wild and also use it as a location to film.<br>
We take the homes of many <b>animals</b> some of which are <b>endangered</b> as well.<br><br>

<b>Yes</b><br>
The Rainforest is home to many different exotic <b>animals</b> some of which are <b>endangered</b> and losing their homes due to deforestation.<br>
Some animals that are going extinct are:<br>
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li>Jaguars</li>
	<li>Giant Otters</li>
	<li>Various Breeds of <b>Monkeys</b></li>
	<li>Poisinous <b>Frogs</b></li>
	<li>Many different <b>birds</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:'Tahoma';">
<p style="font-size:20px;">
These animals are essential to keep <b>food-chains</b> stable as well as help out the habitat they stay in.<br>
The monkeys also help the Rainforest in a speacial way called <abbr title="A form of pollination whereby pollen is transferred by animals"><b>Zoophily.</b></abbr><br>
The Rainforest has around <b>40,000 plant species</b>, nearly <b>1,300 bird species</b>, <b>3,000 types of fish</b>, <b>427 species of mammals</b>, and <b>2.5 million different insects.</b><br>
<br>
Learning more about the animals in the Rainforest can help us better our understanding and educate others!

<b>Not at all!</b><br>
Our Rainforests have been through a lot and are not in the best state, but we can <b>still help!</b><br>
Some minor things you can do to help are:<br>
<ul>
<ul style="font-size:20px;">
	<li>You can save rainforests by <b>reducing</b> your use of products that are grown on cleared rainforest lands.</b>
	<li>Go <b>paperless</b> at home and in the office.</li>
	<li>Buy recycled products and then <b>recycle</b> them again.</li>
	<li>Buy certified wood products. Read the labels and look for the <abbr title="Forest Stewardship Council"><b>FSC</b></abbr> mark.<br>
	<li>Raise <b>awareness</b> in your circle and in your community.</li><br>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
And if you aren't able to do any of these...<br>
You can donate to different foundations that help preserve and save the Rainforest.<br>
One popular foundation to donate to is <a href="https://www.rainforesttrust.org/?utm_source=google-grant&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=rt-branded&utm_term=rainforest%20trust&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiZqhBhCJARIsACHHEH8G611EiHPdGauUiefrbuHxE03PD5ihSx0VRWWYGwfQ-ju_rvoIxugaAsXlEALw_wcB"
